# DJ_Laser's React Web Template

This template is mainly intended so I can create new web apps easily, but anyone can feel free to use it.

I wanted to only have to so through setting up node stuff one last time since i use these frameworks together so often.

It also has a nix flake to setup node automagically via direnv.

When cloning, make sure to change the vite `base` config option to your repo name, and don't forget to change the tile and favicon silly :/
